  abstract     = {The latest project from the FANTOM consortium, an international collaborative effort initiated by RIKEN, generated atlases of transcriptomes, in particular promoters, transcribed enhancers, and long-noncoding RNAs, across a diverse set of mammalian cell types. Here, we introduce the FANTOM5 collection, bringing together data descriptors, articles and analyses of FANTOM5 data published across the Nature Research journals. Associated data are openly available for reuse by all.},
